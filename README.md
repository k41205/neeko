To-do:

- mergedFields view (create new component with display none and display it whenever the field is hovered)
- input control on forms (field, container) + css (js code into components to check form validity)
- update UI for every action/eliminate container button (could be dealt with a custom hook to recall into components where an action that apport a change is required)
- enable edit operation on click of label or name container

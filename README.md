# Neeko

A simple app where you can plan your month expenses by creating a stack container with all the expenses you made in it.

It's my first app created with React to put in practice what I studied some months earlier. The backend is managed through Firebase.

You can give a look at it here:

Todo list:

- Improve number format
- Order container for total amount and data creation
- Secure delete function for containers (ask you to digit the name of the container you are deleting)
- Edit and delete container icons appearing on hover a container and need to create a hidden space on the top of the container where to put them in order to hover the container and be still able to click the icons without them disappearing.
- Data validation rules on Firestore

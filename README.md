To-do:

- implement uuid for fields (use it as key prop on Field component)
- delete a field of a container
- enable edit operation on click of label or name container
- mergedFields view to format better and fix the visibility bug

Other things I could implement:

- change from hover to onClick to show the merged fields
- secure delete function (ask you to digit the name of the container you are deleting)
